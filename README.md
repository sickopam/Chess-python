# Online Multiplayer Chess
Description: An online multiplayer chess game. Supports infinite players playing against random opponents on different machines on different networks. This project was created using python 3.7, pygame and the sockets module from python3. It runs on a basic client server system where a server script handles all incoming connections and game management. The clients simply hanlde the UI and game play.


# How it works
Start with running the server file with 'python server.py'. Then open two new terminals and on each of them run 'python game.py'. The program will then ask for the player's name and then open pygame. The players each take turns making moves until one quits or checkmates the other player.

# Heads up
Make sure to not rush your moves, just like a normal chess game. Rushing your moves will cause the program to crash and you have to run the program again.

# Credits
This program was made by <a href='https://github.com/techwithtim'>techwithtim</a>. I, Naufal, along with my colleagues, Alfi and Rifki, only made a few changes to try and improve the speed of the program.
